                        <h3>Do you travel for filming across Canada, and are travel fees different by province?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, we provide video production services across all Canadian provinces and territories, from British Columbia to Newfoundland and Labrador, including the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon. Travel fees vary based on distance from our base locations and may include transportation costs (flights, vehicle rental, fuel), accommodation for crew members, per diem allowances for meals, and equipment shipping when necessary. Projects within major metropolitan areas like Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, and Ottawa typically have minimal travel fees, while remote locations or smaller communities may require additional travel budget.

                        <h3>What is your typical turnaround time for video editing and final delivery?</h3>
                        <p>Our standard turnaround times vary by project complexity: simple event highlights or wedding trailers typically take 2-3 weeks, corporate videos and commercial productions require 3-6 weeks, complex brand storytelling videos with extensive post-production need 4-8 weeks, and drone videography projects are usually completed within 1-2 weeks. These timelines include professional video editing and colour grading, music licensing, sound design, and delivery in multiple formats. Rush delivery is available for urgent projects with expedited fees. We provide detailed project timelines during planning and send regular progress updates throughout the post-production process. Factors affecting turnaround include footage volume, revision rounds, client feedback timing, and seasonal demand fluctuations.</p>

                        <p>Yes, we provide professional drone videography services across Canada in full compliance with Transport Canada regulations. Our certified drone pilots hold valid pilot certificates and operate under the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs).

                        <p>Yes, we understand Canada's linguistic diversity and offer comprehensive bilingual services for English and French audiences. Our services include bilingual scripting and voice-over recording, French and English subtitle creation, closed captioning for accessibility compliance, translation services for existing content, and cultural adaptation to ensure messaging resonates with both linguistic communities.

                        <h3>Who owns the footage, and how does licensing/usage rights work for commercial videos in Canada?</h3>
                        <p>Ownership and usage rights are clearly defined in our contracts before production begins. For most projects, clients receive full ownership of the final edited video and usage rights for their intended purposes. Raw footage ownership varies by agreement type: corporate and commercial clients typically receive raw footage after final payment, while wedding and event clients receive edited highlights with raw footage available upon request. Commercial usage rights include specifications for geographic distribution (local, national, international), duration of usage rights, platform permissions (broadcast, web, social media), and modification rights. We ensure all music licensing, talent releases, and location permissions are properly secured. Our contracts comply with Canadian copyright law and intellectual property regulations, providing clear protection for both parties.</p>

                        <p>Yes, we have extensive experience filming in diverse Canadian locations and handle all necessary permits and permissions. For indoor venues, we coordinate with facility managers, obtain filming permissions, ensure insurance requirements are met, and work within venue-specific guidelines and restrictions.

Our location services include site surveys to assess lighting and acoustic conditions, equipment logistics planning, and backup location identification.

                        <p>Booking your video production project is straightforward and professional. The process begins with an initial consultation (phone, video call, or in-person) to discuss your vision, requirements, and timeline. We then provide a detailed proposal including scope, timeline, deliverables, and investment. Upon agreement, we prepare a comprehensive contract outlining all terms, responsibilities, and deliverables. Our standard terms require a 50% deposit to secure your date and begin pre-production, with the balance due upon final delivery. We accept various payment methods including e-transfer, corporate cheques, and credit cards. Contracts include clear cancellation policies, weather contingency plans for outdoor shoots, and detailed delivery schedules. We recommend booking 4-8 weeks in advance for optimal date availability, especially during peak wedding and corporate event seasons.</p>
